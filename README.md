Linear Regression Modelling Using MATLAB

ELE829 - System Modelling and Identification was a 4th year Electrical Engineering course at Ryerson, Linear Regression Modelling
was one of its major project. In this project, there were two data sets of static non-linear systems, an identification data set and 
a validated data set. The code in this repository was used to determine the appropriate Linear Regression Model of the system via 
Least Square Estimate method.
