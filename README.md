Linear Regression Modelling Using MATLAB

ELE829 - System Modelling and Identification was a 4th year Electrical Engineering course at Ryerson, Linear Regression Modelling
was one of its major project. In this project, there were two data sets of static non-linear systems; an identification data set and 
a validated data set. The code in this repository was used to determine the appropriate Linear Regression Model of the system via 
Least Square Estimate method. Furthermore, after identifying the model, the Normality test and the Chi-Squared Test were done to validate the model.

The file "proj1dataset01" contains the static non-linear systems data sets.
